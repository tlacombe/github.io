In order to run Jupyter notebook in the proper virtual environment, you must run the following command  *before* launching jupyter notebook in a terminal on your session in the lab machine. To open a Terminal, you can click on "Applications" (top left) and then "Terminal". What is before the '$' symbol must not be copy pasted.

[your machine ~]$ export PATH="/usr/local/anaconda3-5.0.0/bin:$PATH"
[your machine ~]$ conda create -n cse204 python=3.6 scikit-learn ipykernel
[your machine ~]$ source activate cse204
(cse204) [your machine ~]$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name cse204 --display-name "Python (cse204)"

(cse204) [your machine ~]$ jupyter-notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8080

And then, just work with the lab_exam.ipynb file. This is the file that you will have to upload on Moodle at the end of the lab session.
